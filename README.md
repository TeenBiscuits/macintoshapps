## App Submission Guidelines

Submit an application by making a pull request on GitHub. Add a directory under `src/content/apps` -- the directory's name should be the name of the app. Inside the directory, there should be two files:

- An `index.md` file with the appropriate frontmatter
- Your app's icon (any format is fine if it supports transluscency. Make sure it is linked correcty in the `index.md` frontmatter.)

Please ensure yoru app icon is square and has the appropriate margins.

Here's an example of what the `index.md` looks like for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com).
