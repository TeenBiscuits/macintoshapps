> NetNewsWire shows you articles from your favorite blogs and news sites and keeps track of what youâ€™ve read.

NetNewsWire uses Real Simple Syndication (RSS) to display articles from your favorite resources on the Internet. Users can subscribe to an RSS feed and NetNewsWire will update automatically to show you the latest content.

There's been a bit of a RSS resurgence recently as people started rejecting algorthimcally generated news in favor of manually curating their own feeds. NetNewsWire is thoughtfully designed, simple by default, and remarkably stable. It's available on multiple Apple platforms and syncs via iCloud so your devices are up to date.

The GitHub repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire).
