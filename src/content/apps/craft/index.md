> Craft is a note-taking app, word processor, to-do list, and personal organizer. It helps you get your ideas and life in order. And it keeps your documents looking sharp and never more than a few keystrokes away.

Craft won Mac App of the Year in 2021 and it's easy to see why. Their founder, Balint Orosz, said his aim was to strike a balance between an empowering tool and a delightful experience. With Craft you structure documents inside of pages and cards. The documents can contain text, tables, images, and even whiteboards. These notes can then be nested inside of other notes. By adding links to connect them, you can create your own personal wiki. You can also choose to publish your notes to the public internet, as well as export them in a variety of formats.

Craft's free starter tier allows you to create 10 documents for free, with 2 additional documents per week after that. There is a storage limit on documents, so you can't go uploading 4K movies and using it as a cloud storage system. The Plus plan is $10/month and unlocks unlimited documents, although I have found conflicting information on how much storage is you are actually allotted. There is also a family plan for up to 5 members for $18/month.

Craft has an Education plan available to students, faculty, and staff members of academic institutions. There are native apps for macOS, ipadOS, and iOS. There is also a web app and a Windows app, though I suspect the Windows application is a wrapper of the web one.
