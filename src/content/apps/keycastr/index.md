> KeyCastr enables you to share your keystrokes when creating screencasts, presenting, or collaborating with others. You can display command keys, modifier keys, all keystrokes, and mouse clicks.

If you record tutorials or consistently make screen recordings, displaying keystrokes helps your audience follow along with your actions. KeyCastr is a free, open source keystroke visualizer that looks professional and is customizable. You have the option to display all keystrokes or only keystrokes that are pressed alongside a modifier key like <kbd>⌘</kbd> or <kbd>⌥</kbd>. There is also an option to enable mouse click visualization to further emphasize your onscreen actions.

KeyCastr's repository can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr). The software has been available for free on Mac since 2009.
