> IINA is born to be a modern macOS application, from its framework to the user interface. It adopts the post-Yosemite design language of macOS and keeps up the pace of new technologies like Picture-in-Picture.

Those familiar with open source software have probably heard of VLC, the media player that can playback virtually any format you can imagine. VLC is a hall of fame level piece of software but I think many will agree that it's design can look somewhat dated. IINA is a great replacement for VLC that offers the same media playback support with a modern day GUI interface.

To get the latest stable release, check out their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/iina/iina) or the [official IINA website](https://iina.io).
