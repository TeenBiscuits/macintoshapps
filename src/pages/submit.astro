      You can submit an app by making a pull request on <a
        href="https://github.com/trevortylerlee/macintoshapps">GitHub</a
      >. Add a directory under <code>src/content/apps</code> -- the directory's name
      should be the name of the app. Inside the directory, there should be two files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An <code>index.md</code> file with the appropriate frontmatter</li><li
      >
        Your app's icon (any format is fine if it supports transluscency. Make
        sure it is linked correcty in the <code>index.md</code> frontmatter.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please ensure your app icon is square, sized correctly (under 512px Ã—
      512px), and has appropriate margins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an example of what the <code>index.md</code> looks like for <a
        href="https://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a
      >.
